## Townbase

Every day begins with fragmentation. Your tasks live in one app, your notes in another, your links scattered across browser tabs, your team's status somewhere in Slack, and your personal life completely siloed from all of it. You context-switch constantly — not because the work demands it, but because your tools demand it.

There is no single place that knows who you are, what you are trying to do today, and who you are doing it with. You build that picture yourself, every morning, manually — and it collapses by noon.

## The Idea

Townbase is a personal workspace that acts as the single surface you open your device to. It is not another note-taking app. It is not another task manager. It is the layer that sits above all of those things and organises your day, your people, and your life into one coherent, private space.

The core insight is simple: context is everything. A person is not just one thing. You are a developer on a team during the day, a friend in a group chat in the evening, and someone catching up on personal hobbies at night. Most tools treat you as one flat identity. Townbase lets you be all of those — each with its own space, its own priorities, and its own awareness of what matters right now.

## How It Feels to Use It

You open the app in the morning. Townbase already knows something: you left yesterday with unfinished tasks. It tells you plainly. You work through them. Then a notification surfaces — your team's project is falling behind because one member has stalled on their part. You leave your workspace and step into theirs. You message them. They are stuck. You take the tasks, complete them, and the project is back on track.

Later, you switch profiles. The work context fades. Now you are in your personal space. It tells you that a new episode of a show you are watching aired last night. You have been in the middle of a series for weeks. It knows where you left off.

This is not a collection of features. It is a continuous, aware companion that understands the rhythm of your day and surfaces what is relevant when it is relevant.

## Core Concepts

### The Vault

Your private home. Notes, tasks, saved links, code snippets, passwords, and anything else you want to keep. Everything here is yours alone — encrypted, organised, and accessible only to you. The Vault is the anchor of your day. Nothing stored here is visible to anyone unless you deliberately choose to share it.

### Profiles

A Profile is a context. You might have a Work profile, a Personal profile, a Creative project profile. Each profile has its own:

- Tasks and priorities
- Notifications and what triggers them
- Connected people and teams
- Relevant feeds and trackers

Switching profiles is not just a visual change. It is a genuine shift in what the app considers important to show you.

### The Town Hall

Step out of your private vault and into a shared space with your team or friends. The Town Hall is a lightweight communication layer — closer to a focused group workspace than a full chat platform. You can see who is around, what they are working on, share files, and coordinate. It is deliberately minimal. The goal is presence and coordination, not endless conversation.

### Encrypted Sharing

When you need to share something sensitive — a file, a credential, a private note — Townbase encrypts it before it ever leaves your device. The recipient decrypts it on theirs. Nothing is stored or passed in readable form. Third-party storage providers can be used for the actual file hosting; they only ever see ciphertext.

## The Self-Hosting Philosophy

Townbaseis not a service you subscribe to. It is software you own. Anyone can fork the repository, plug in their own credentials and storage, and run a private instance for themselves, their team, or their household. No data passes through infrastructure you did not choose. No company holds your information. The software is the product — not the platform.

This makes Townbase especially well-suited for small teams, independent developers, and privacy-conscious individuals who want the collaboration and convenience of modern productivity tools without surrendering control of their data.

## What Townbase Is Not

- It is not a replacement for deep project management tools like Linear or Jira.
- It is not a social network or a public platform.
- It is not a cloud service with vendor lock-in.
- It is not trying to do everything — it is trying to connect the things that matter most in one place.
